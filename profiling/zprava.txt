The output.pdf file contains the profiler outputs of our program calculating the standard deviation.
The program was executed and fed with 10, 100 and 1000 random values.

The program spends the most time executing functions:
	power():
		called: n + 1 times OVERALL
	squared_sum():
		custom function of profiling code
		power() function is called here n times
		called: 1 time
	sum():
		custom function of profiling code
		add() is executed here, it has little efect on overall execution time though
		called: 1 time
	nqrt():
		called: 1 time
		has long execution time, it is called only once though => impact on low amount of input values

In the future we should focus on improvimg the power() function and mabe optimize the nqrt() function.

Profiler used: Callgrind
Interface: Kcachegrind
