Expectation vs Reality:
	* Tasks that seemed easy prooved to be a lot harder, eg. un/installer, GUI using QT
	
	* Parallel development of tests and math/hfunc implementation

Overall, we were successful in implementing everything we claimed we would and we managed to hold the deadlines and push to the repo in time.
